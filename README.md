# Collectio

Collectio is a little project to learn tkinter library basics.
I needed a simple local pc app to manage my games/books collection but
i didn't find what i was looking for. So i decided to create it.

App is still in progress and are very very limited, and it is strictly in french.
It's a poor prototype at this stage. 
Features :
- adding games
- saving collection
- reading saved collection

no preview, no filters, everything is yet to be done ;-)
